# Ongoing Research Project

## Stochastic ODEs and AI Integration for Stock Price Prediction

### Overview

This research project investigates the application of artificial intelligence techniques to stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) in dynamical systems, with a focus on stock price prediction. We aim to develop novel methods for solving and analyzing SODEs using machine learning algorithms to improve financial forecasting.

### Key Aspects

- **AI-driven SODE Solvers**: Developing advanced solvers for complex stochastic differential equations used in financial modeling.
- **Neural Networks for Prediction**: Exploring deep learning techniques to predict the behavior of stochastic financial systems.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Investigating RL algorithms for optimal decision-making in volatile market conditions.

### Mathematical Foundation

We base our research on the following stochastic differential equation:

$$ dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t $$

Where:
- $S_t$ is the stock price at time $t$
- $\mu$ is the drift (average rate of return)
- $\sigma$ is the volatility
- $W_t$ is a Wiener process

Our AI model aims to approximate solutions:

$$ \hat{S}_t = \text{NN}_\theta(t, W_t, \text{market data}) $$

### Expected Impact

This research aims to significantly improve stock price prediction accuracy and develop more robust trading strategies in volatile markets.
