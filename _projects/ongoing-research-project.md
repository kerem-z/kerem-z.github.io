1. **Stochastic Differential Equations**: We use the Black-Scholes model as a foundation:

   $$dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dW$$

   Where $S$ is the stock price, $\mu$ is the drift, $\sigma$ is the volatility, and $dW$ is a Wiener process.

2. **AI Integration**: We employ neural networks to estimate parameters and enhance predictions.

## Methodology

Our approach involves:

1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Stochastic ODE model formulation
3. AI model design and training
4. Hybrid model integration
5. Backtesting and performance evaluation

## Preliminary Results

Initial findings suggest that our hybrid approach outperforms traditional methods by approximately 15% in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

$$MAPE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n \left|\frac{A_t - F_t}{A_t}\right| \times 100\%$$

Where $A_t$ is the actual value and $F_t$ is the forecast value.

## Next Steps

We are currently working on:

1. Refining the AI component to better capture market sentiment
2. Extending the model to handle multi-asset portfolios
3. Investigating the impact of macroeconomic factors on model performance

Stay tuned for updates!
